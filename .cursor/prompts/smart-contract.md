# Smart Contract Development with MCP

Help me develop a secure and efficient smart contract for BNB Chain.

## Use the following MCP servers:

### ⛓️ Tatum.io Blockchain
- Check current BNB gas prices
- Validate contract deployment requirements
- Simulate contract interactions
- Monitor network status

### 🔒 Endgame Security
- Audit contract for vulnerabilities
- Check for reentrancy attacks
- Validate access control mechanisms
- Review gas optimization

### 🧠 Sequential Thinking
- Analyze contract logic and flow
- Identify potential failure points
- Suggest gas optimizations
- Plan testing strategy

## Contract Requirements:

```solidity
// Contract specification
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract MyContract {
    // Contract details and requirements
}
```

## Development Checklist:
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Gas optimization implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Deployment simulation successful
- [ ] Documentation complete
