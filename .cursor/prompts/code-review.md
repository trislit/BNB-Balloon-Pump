# Code Review with MCP Servers

I need to review this code for quality, performance, and security issues.

## Use the following MCP servers:

### ü§î Sequential Thinking
Analyze the code logic and identify:
- Algorithm efficiency
- Code complexity
- Potential optimizations
- Logic errors or edge cases

### üîí Endgame Security
Check for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Input validation issues
- Authentication/authorization problems
- Data exposure risks

### üìÅ File System
Examine related files:
- Check imports and dependencies
- Review related configuration files
- Analyze test coverage

## Code to review:

```javascript
// Paste your code here
function processUserData(data) {
  // Your implementation
}
```

## Expected analysis format:
1. **Summary**: Overall code quality assessment
2. **Issues**: Critical problems found
3. **Recommendations**: Suggested improvements
4. **Security**: Security concerns and fixes
5. **Performance**: Optimization opportunities
